<h1>How to setup a standard Persian keyboard for Windows 2000</h1>

<p>This is a mini-HOWTO for setting up <strong>standard</strong>
Persian (Farsi) keyboard layout, <a href="http://www.isiri.org/std/2901.htm">ISIRI&nbsp;2901:1994</a>, on
<strong>Windows 2000</strong> systems. This keyboard layout is the
national Iranian standard, and is the best Persian keyboard layout
the FarsiWeb project knows about. It has one of the shortest
learning curves for inexperienced users, and has a complete
repertoire of characters used in Persian without using
<strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Alt</strong> keys.</p>

<p>ISIRI 2900 is much much easier to use than Microsoft's Farsi
keyboard, has Persian digits instead of European ones, and provides
an easy mechanism for entering Pseudo Space using
<em>Shift+Space</em>, among other features. (Microsoft's Windows
team is aware of this standard layout. According to our contacts
with Microsoft, they may adopt this layout in a later version of
Windows.)</p>

<p><span class="note"><span class="warning">Note:</span> We do not
know of any possible side effects, but since you are replacing a
Windows driver, this might create problems for your system. If you
are not an experienced computer user, do this on a test
installation first to make sure you understand the procedure. Also
please note that this will not work on Windows&nbsp;95, 98 or
ME.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that you have the Microsoft Farsi Keyboard in your
system, running properly.</li>

<li>Backup the following file from your system. You will need to
replace it if the system did not work properly:
<strong>\WINNT\system32\kbdfa.dll</strong></li>

<li>Download FarsiWeb's version of <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/farsitools/kbdfa.dll">kbdfa.dll</a>.</li>

<li>Login to your system as an "administrator".</li>

<li>From the "Start" menu, select "Run...". Type "regedit".</li>

<li>In the left panel, expand <strong>"My
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>
\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"</strong>.
In the right panel, double-click on <strong>"SFCDisable"</strong>
and change its value from "0" to "1". Close regedit.</li>

<li><em>This step is tricky, read it completely before you start it:</em>
<br> From the "Start" menu, select "Run...". Type
<strong>"sfc&nbsp;&nbsp;/purgecache"</strong>. A dialog box may open, asking
you to insert your Windows 2000 installation CD. Do <strong>not</strong> do
that. Select "Cancel" instead. In the next dialog, press "Yes". Then close
the "Windows File Protection" program immediately by either closing the
window or pressing it's "Cancel" button. On some systems, the CD requesting
dialog may not appear, only the "Windows File Protection" program will
start. If that's the case with your system, close it after about 10 seconds
of running.</li>

<li>Restart your system and login as an "administrator".</li>

<li>Copy the FarsiWeb's version of <strong>"kbdfa.dll"</strong>
over <strong>"\WINNT\system32\kbdfa.dll"</strong>. A "Windows File
Protection" dialog will appear again. Press "Cancel" again. Select
"Yes" in the next dialog box (telling that you want to keep the
unrecognized file versions).</li>

<li>Restart the computer again.</li>

<li>To see if the keyboard is running properly, open <strong>"Start
| Programs | Accessories | Accessiblity | On-Screen
Keyboard"</strong>. Now switch the keyboard to "Farsi". If you see
Persian digits instead of European ones, the keyboard is properly
installed. <em>Congratulations!</em></li>
