#       General notes:
#
#       This table contains the list of Iranian official holidays.
#
#       Format:  Two columns
#                Column #1 specifies which calendar is used for the holiday,
#                   'S' for Solar Islamic (Hejri-e Shamsi) and 'L' for
#                   Lunar Islamic (Hejri-e Ghamari).
#                Column #2 is the date in the MM/DD format, first the
#                   month number and then the day number, zero-padded to two
#                   digits.
#
#       The entries are sorted, first based on the calendar used, and then
#       based on the month and day numbers.
