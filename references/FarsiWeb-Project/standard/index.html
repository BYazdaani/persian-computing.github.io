<h1>Persian Information Interchange Standard</h1>

<p>The FarsiWeb Project Group is proud to announce the final version of
<strong>"Information Technology  Persian Information Interchange and
Display Mechanism, using Unicode"</strong>. This standard was prepared
under a contract with <a href="http://www.hci.or.ir/">High Council of
Informatics of Iran</a> (HCI), and was supported by <a href="http://www.science-arts.org/">Science and Arts Foundation</a>, HCI,
and <a href="http://www.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of
Technology</a>.</p>

<p>The first draft was presented at a seminar hosted by HCI on
September&nbsp;12,
2001, and has been heavily revised based on comments from linguistic and
computing experts and developers. It was then approved by the National
Standards Committee of Computers and Data Processing of <a href="http://www.isiri.org/">Institute of Standards and Industrial Research
of Iran</a> to become a national standard, on its two meetings on
March&nbsp;10 and May&nbsp;8, 2002.</p>

<p>Any comments should be sent to the FarsiWeb Project Group directly, at <a href="mailto:FWPG@sharif.edu">FWPG@sharif.edu</a> or to the <a href="http://lists.sharif.edu/mailman/listinfo/farsiweb/">FarsiWeb
discussion list</a>, after subscription. All these comments will be
considered in the next ammendments to the text of the standard.</p>
