**Zarnegar** (Persian: , zarnegār, meaning *gold-depicting*) is a commercial, stand-alone [Persian]/[Arabic] word processor program developed by [SinaSoft Corporation] for [MS-DOS] and [Windows]. The first version of Zarnegar (for DOS), was released in April-May 1991, and Windows versions have been available since 2000.

History
-------

Before Zarnegar, DOS-based [text editors], like [Safhe-Ara] (Persian: , safhe-ārā), a Persian-enabled [Personal Editor 2] (a.k.a. PE2) and [Pishkar] (Persian: پیش‌کار, pish-kār, the first product of [SinaSoft]), were available which allowed basic [monospaced] desktop publishing.

Zarnegar was one of the first word processor applications with real support for the Persian alphabet (and Arabic script, in general), therefore, establishing new methods of [desktop publishing] and handling the alphabet in the digital environment.

The name, Zarnegar, a [portmanteau], contains the word [Zar] (Persian: , meaning *gold*), the name of the very first typeface supported by this software. The first version of Zarnegar was released with two fonts: [Zar] and [Terafik]. After that, new fonts were added to Zarnegar every few months, which later became the source of most Persian fonts on [Windows] systems.

The main development of Zarnegar happened between 1991 and 1995, with the heaviest work done in 1993 and 1994. In the 1990s, Zarnegar was more popular than the competitors, possibly because of variety and beauty of the bundled fonts, ease of use, and paying attention to market needs, support and education.

-   Persian/Arabic justification with advanced options (see following list for details).
-   Embedded [Persian] dictionaries (for various areas, like math, chemistry, physics, geography, proper names, computing, and one for etymology) for [spell checking], with possibility of creating new dictionaries to share with other users.
-   Sorting and collation, per language (Persian/English) or using system language (in Windows, only).
-   On-screen measurement of rendered text, in both DOS and Windows versions.
-   Customizable keyboard layouts (Persian, Arabic and English).

### Paragraph Justification

Zarnegar has advanced support for Persian/Arabic paragraph justification, supporting the following options:

-   Manual insertion of Kashida character.
-   Length of [Kashida character]: short, medium, long, very long.
-   Length of [Whitespace character].
-   Percentage of letter spacing reduction.
-   Percentage of using Kashida vs. Space character.
-   Per-word selection of elongation method (where to place Kashida in a word).

Encodings
---------

Zarnegar has employed two different character sets and file formats.

### Zarnegar1 Character Set

*Zarnegar* used an [Iran System]-based character encoding system, named *Zarnegar1*, with text file formats for its early versions, up to the *Zarnegar 75* version. *Zarnegar1* character set is a 2-form left-to-right (visual) encoding, meaning that every [Perso-Arabic] letter receives different character codes based on its cursive joining form, but most letters receive only 2 forms, because of the limited code-points available2 forms, because of the limited code-points available.

### Zarnegar75 Character Set

With *Zarnegar 75* version of the program, a new character encoding system was introduced, and the file format was changed to a binary format. *Zarnegar75* character set is a 4-form bidirectional visual encoding, meaning that every [Perso-Arabic] letter receives one, two, or four character code, depending on its cursive joining form, and these letters are stored in the memory in the semantic order.

  [Four examples of justification of a Persian text, using different parameter values: top-right) justification without Kashida, top-left) justification with 50% Kashida (and 50% Space), bottom-right) justification with 100% Kashida, applied on first position in a word, bottom-left) justification with 100% Kashida, distributed in a word.]: Zarnegar_-_Justification_Examples.png "Four examples of justification of a Persian text, using different parameter values: top-right) justification without Kashida, top-left) justification with 50% Kashida (and 50% Space), bottom-right) justification with 100% Kashida, applied on first position in a word, bottom-left) justification with 100% Kashida, distributed in a word."
