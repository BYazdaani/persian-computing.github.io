# Persian-Computing Community

This is a new home for the [Persian-Computing Community](http://persian-computing.org/).

The repository hosts binary (e.g. images and PDF documents) and computer-friendly text files
(like source code and mapping tables), whilc [the
wiki](/wiki) hosts human-friendly content,
authored by community members.

----

NOTE: We are in the transition process from the old (Mediawiki-based) website:
<http://wiki.persian-computing.org/wiki/>. The reason for the move is to make it easier for
community members to contribute and share common resources, while reducing maintainace costs.
